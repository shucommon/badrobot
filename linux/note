linux boot requirements
    RBL             Run bootloader  runs out of ROM
    SPL/MLO         Runs out of internal SRAM, SPL stands for "secondary program loader", MLO(Memory LOader), the job of the second stage boot loader is to load and execute the third stage boot loader such as u-boot 
    U-boot          Runs out of DDR
    Linux kernel    runs out of DDR
    RFS             SD/Flash/Network/RAM/e-MMC

Don’t be scared by looking at the table, but just concentrate on SYSBOOT[4:0]
“SYSBOOT” is one of the register of this SOC and its first five bits decide the boot order .

Let’s take an example,
When SYSBOOT [4:0] = 00000b (This is reserved, you cannot use this configuration)
When SYSBOOT [4:0] = 00001b
After the RESET if SYSBOOT [4:0] = 00001b , then SOC will try to boot from UART0 first , if fails, then it tries to boot from XIP(XIP stands for eXutable In Place memory like NOR Flash), if that also fails, then it will try to boot from MMC0, if no success, finally it tries to boot from SPI0, if that also fails, then SOC outputs the error message and stops. 

1. When you reset the SOC, the code stored in the ROM of the SOC runs first !
2. The code stored in the “ROM” is called ROM boot loader, this is programmed in to the ROM of the SOC during taping out of the chip, you cannot able to change it, why?? Because its ROM. Read only !!!!
3. The job of the ROM is to set up the SOC clock, watch dog timer, etc and also its major job is to load the second stage boot loader, what we call MLO or SPL, more on this later.

Now, from where it should load the second stage boot loader?
1. For that what ROM code does is, it reads the register SYSBOOT [15:0], and based on the value of SYSBOOT[4:0] it prepares the list of booting devices. The register SYSBOOT [15:0] value is decided by the voltage level on the SYSBOOT pins.
2. That is, let’s say, if SYSBOOT[4:0] = 00011b, then boot order will be , UART0,SPI0.XIP,MMC0 ( look at the table please !!! )
3. So, we can say that, The SYSBOOT pins configure the boot device order (set by SYSBOOT[4:0]).
    for bbb:
        1) S2 Released (SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11100)
        The boot order will be
        MMC1 (eMMC)
        MMC0 (SD card)
        UART0
        USB0

        2) S2 pressed (SYSBOOT[4:0] = 11000) , The boot order will be
        SPI0
        MMC0 (SD card)
        USB0
        UART0
