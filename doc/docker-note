1 Docker ecosystem
    container core technology
        container standard  -> Open Container Initiative(OCI)
            runtime spec
            image format spec

        container runtime
            lxc  linux originate, container use this at beginning
            runc docker developped, it's default now
            rkt  developped by CoreOS

        container managerment tools
            lxd -> lxc
            docker engine -> runc
                deamon
                cli
            rkt cli -> rkt

        container define tools
            docker image : template of docker container, runtime depend on docker image to create container
            dockerfile: contain cmds to create docker image
            ACI(App Container Image): image of rtk by CoreOS

        Registries
            Docker Registry: for enterprise
            Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com) : public registry
            Quay.io(https://quay.io/) : public registry

        container OS - OS specific for running container
            coreos
            atoic
            ubuntu core

    container platform technology - make container running as cluster in distribute system
        container orchestration(编排) engine - container management, schedule, cluster define, service discover, form a microservice application
            docker swarm - developped by docker
            kubernetes - by Google, support docker, CoreOS container
            mesos+marathon

        container manage platform - contruct based on container orchestration
            Rancher
            ContainerShip

        PaaS based on container
            Deis
            Flynn
            Dokku
        
    container support technology
        Docker network
            docker network
            flannel
            weave
            calico

        Service discover - save microservice latest info in cluster(ip/port), provide API for outside
            etcd
            consul
            zookeeper

        Monitor
            docker ps/top/stats
            docker stats API - HTTP
            sysdig
            cAdvisor/Heapster
            Weave Scope

        Data manage - migrate between host
            Flocker

        Log manage
            docker logs
            logspout
