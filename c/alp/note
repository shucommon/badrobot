## chapter 2
You can view the GNU Coding
Standards’ guidelines for command-line options by invoking the following from a shell
prompt on most GNU/Linux systems:
% info “(standards)User Interfaces”

% program > output_file.txt 2>&1
% program 2>&1 | filter
The 2>&1 syntax indicates that file descriptor 2 (stderr) should be merged into
file descriptor 1 (stdout). Note that 2>&1 must follow a file redirection (the first example)
but must precede a pipe redirection (the second example).

Note that even though the parameter type of the exit function is int and the main
function returns an int, Linux does not preserve the full 32 bits of the return code. In
fact, you should use exit codes only between zero and 127. Exit codes above 128 have
a special meaning—when a process is terminated by a signal, its exit code is 128 plus
the signal number.
